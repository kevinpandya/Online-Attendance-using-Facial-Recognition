Instructions on how to Compile and Run the program files

1) How to compile and run Java programs <br>
-> Make sure to have java version 8 or higher installed in your device <br>
-> To run the java programs using an IDE, you can use Eclipse or Intellij <br>
-> Open the files MergeSort.java and QuickSort.java in any of these IDEs <br>
-> After that build and run the programs to get the results in the terminal <br>
-> It will also generate the output files containing the sorted data and statistics data <br>
-> To run the java programs using command prompt <br>
-> Open the command prompt at the directory path where the java programs are stored <br>
-> To build the program run the command javac MergeSort.java and javac QuickSort.java <br>
-> This will create class files MergeSort.class and QuickSort.class <br>
-> To run the programs execute the command java MergeSort.java and java QuickSort.java <br>
-> This will generate the output in the terminal and will generate output files containing the sorted data and statistics data <br>


2) How to compile and run Python programs <br>
-> Make sure to have python version 3.* installed in your device <br>
-> To have latest version of pip, run the command, python -m pip install --upgrade pip in command prompt <br>
-> We have used psutil module in our program <br>
-> To install the module run the command, pip install psutil in the command prompt <br>
-> To run the Python programs open the command prompt at the directory path where the python programs are stored <br>
-> To run MergeSort.py , run the command python MergeSort.py and the outputs will be generated on the terminal <br>
-> To run QuickSort.py , run the command python QuickSort.py and the outputs will be generated on the terminal <br>
-> After the programs are executed succefully, output files will be generated which will contain the sorted input data and statistics data <br>
